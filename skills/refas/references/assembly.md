# Immutable child assembly

## Closure boundary

Once a child asset passes its own gates, treat its GLB bytes, local coordinate frame, and digest as immutable inputs to parent assembly. Preserve the closed child rather than regenerating a look-alike inside the parent builder.

Use `appendPartsToClosedGlb` when the parent can be represented by appending nodes, meshes, materials, and binary payload. The implementation preserves the child binary payload as an exact prefix and records both the source GLB SHA-256 and embedded BIN SHA-256 in a composition report.

## Registration record

Every child placement must record:

- child asset path and digest;
- child-local reference frame;
- parent target frame;
- translation, rotation, and scale;
- evidence for the registration;
- contact or attachment relation;
- expected occlusion order.

Keep registration in data, not hidden constants.

Create an assembly contract before placement. It records observed polygons, root anchors, depth bands, relations, support zones, bounded hidden-support hypotheses, closed-child digests, and evidence attestation. Reject cyclic front-to-back claims.

## Assembly gates

Review the actual parent render for:

- attachment location and orientation;
- support and contact;
- gaps, penetration, and floating parts;
- occlusion and depth order;
- seam and tangent continuity;
- grazing-angle continuity;
- object-ID separation;
- unchanged closed-child digest and appearance.

Run `validateRealizedAssembly` against projected part polygons, depths, root support state, mesh analysis, penetration counts, and composition reports. Passing code or a low registration residual is not assembly evidence; an actual parent render is still required.

## Reopening a child

Parent assembly may reveal a true upstream defect. Reopen the child only when a typed finding is owned by the child's capability and is supported by actual render evidence. Preserve the old closed child and create a new candidate; never overwrite it.

If the mismatch can be fixed by parent registration, keep the child closed.
